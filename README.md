Deploy a three-service microservice architecture using Kubernetes and Minikube. This stack mimics AWS EKS production practices with a focus on service isolation, resource management, and ingress exposure.

I used a single Helm chart for deploying all three services (`gateway`, `auth-service`, `data-service`) with their manifests placed in the `templates/` directory.
